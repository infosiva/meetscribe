# HANDOFF — meetscribe design apply
**Date:** 2026-10-06  **Status:** COMPLETE (files only, uncommitted)
**Goal:** Apply design system: unique accent, archetype, hub-switchable theme, honest content.

## Design lock (finalized before code)
- Archetype default: career-portfolio (weak fit, bestFor professional/serious/generate; alternatives worse). Hub can switch via theme_meetscribe.layout.archetype -> html[data-layout].
- Accent #c93d82 (rose-magenta, recording feel), bg #fbf7f5 (warm paper). Registered in design-system/tokens/palette-registry.json.
- Background: AnimatedBg (aurora default, reduced-motion honoured), all colours CSS vars from theme-loader.
- Logo: app/icon.svg + apple icon + Logo component, accent-coloured "Scribe".
- Cleanup: remove http:// tracker script, invented Pro price (mark planned), label sample dialogue as example.
- Telemetry: GA4 hub-gated, consent-gated usage log, /api/log structured errors.
- AI pillars: gateway = existing lib/ai.ts chain; evals/budget/RAG exempt for this pass (design-only), gaps stated not faked.

## Steps
- [x] layout/theme wiring  - [ ] CSS vars  - [ ] logo  - [ ] pricing honesty  - [ ] build  - [ ] screenshots

## Files changed
See git status in meetscribe. Renamed to .bak: icon.tsx (and theme.config.ts for nammatamil). Dead: DesignEffects.tsx (meetscribe).
